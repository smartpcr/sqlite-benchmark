    /// The rollback journal file is created at the start of each transaction and deleted when the transaction commits.

    /// File‐system overhead deleting the journal on every commit.

    /// pros:
    /// 1. Very low file‐system churn (no create/truncate/delete).

    /// Journal file may grow large over time (e.g. after VACUUM).

    /// to recover from.
    /// pros:
    /// 1. Fastest possible commits (no disk writes).

    /// Write-Ahead Logging mode (“WAL”) is an alternative journaling scheme that can dramatically improve concurrency and,
    /// in many cases, write performance. Under the hood, WAL shifts from the default “rollback-journal” (DELETE) mode—
    /// where updates are journaled by making a copy of the original page before modifying—to an append-only log of changes
    /// that is kept in a separate “-wal” file.
    /// pros:
    /// 1. Concurrent readers never block a writer, and a writer doesn’t block readers, giving much higher concurrency.
    /// 2. Fewer fsync() calls—better performance on flaky filesystems.
    /// cons:
    /// 1. You must distribute three files (.db, -wal, -shm).
    /// 2. WAL files can grow large without regular checkpoints.
    /// 3. Not supported on some network‐mounted filesystems.

    /// pros: Zero journaling overhead.
    /// cons:
    /// 1. No atomic commit/rollback guarantees.
    /// 2. Database corruption is almost certain on failure.
